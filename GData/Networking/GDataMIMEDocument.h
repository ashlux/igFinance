// This is a simple class to create a MIME document.  To use, allocate 
// a new GDataMIMEDocument and start adding parts as necessary.  When you are
// done adding parts, call generateInputStream to get an NSInputStream
// containing the contents of your MIME document.
//
// A good reference for MIME is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME

#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

#import "GDataDefines.h"

// headers keys and values should be NSStrings
